# Python_Game01
A rock paper scissors game created to learn and practice python.

Additional features included to personalise this game:
1) Use of ASCII art
2) Use of cowsay package
3) Use of emoji

My train of thought while creating the game flow:
1) To get input from the users on their choice of playing the game with the computer
2) To get input from the users on their choice of rock, paper or scissors
3) Ask for input again if the users key in an invalid input
4) To generate a random choice for computer
5) To determine whether the player or computer wins the game
6) To print out statements to inform players who won
7) To allow players to continue playing if they wish to.
   
The code makes use of:
1) IF statements
2) While loop (continue & break)
3) Defining functions (gloabl & local scope)
4) Dictionaries
5) Random
6) input function
7) f-string
8) sys.exit()
9) ASCII art
10) cowsay
